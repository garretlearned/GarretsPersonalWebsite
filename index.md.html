      <h2>Scholar</h2>
      <p>I am currently a student at California State University Sacramento studying Computer Science,</p>
      <p>I am two semesters from graduating but I am thinking about staying an extra semester to potentially get a Psychology Minor & Math Minor</p>

      <h2>Software Developer</h2>
      <p>My favorite language is C++, however I am fluent in Python, HTML (I coded this website), Java & have some experience working with SQL Databases!</p>
      <p>I originally started at community college, where I had Professor Fowler who had us code multiple small games as mini projects for his class.</p>
      <p>I learned a lot and fell in love with the satisfaction of getting a long, difficult program to finally compile and be everything I imagined it to be!</p>
      <p>Check out my <a href="https://github.com/garretlearned">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://replit.com/@GarretLearned">Replit</a> profiles!</p>

      <h2>Gamer</h2>
      <p>I am a Competitive Gamer at heart, I mainly played League of Legends, and this is a link to my main account, NorCal (<a href="https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/NorCal">https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/NorCal</a>).</p>
      <p>I reached the highest rank of Challenger in the beginning of 2023 and my dream is to hit Rank 1.</p>
      <p>I also played on the Sacramento State eSports club as the mid laner for two years 2021-2022.</p>
      <p>The only other game I play is Rust, however it is something I play much more rarely given how time consuming it is.</p>
